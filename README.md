## Introduction

This project was the first project in which I utilized all the knowledge I learned at Hack Reactor thus far in order to create a front end that attempts to mimic the look and feel of an existing product listing of a popular web application while using a simple database that stores 100 records maximum. This project was done in a team of four while I was in charge of recreating AirBnB's "More Places to Stay" carousel from scratch.
